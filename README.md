# LBP Descriptor

Project for the Parallel Computing exam at the University of Florence.

The  parallel implementation with CUDA for the same project can be found here: [LBP descriptor with CUDA](https://github.com/matpetrone/LBP_Descriptor_CUDA).


Local binary patterns (LBP) is a type of visual descriptor used for classification in computer vision. It has since been found to be a powerful feature for texture classification.
